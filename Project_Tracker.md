# PyDash Application - Project Tracker
project tracker for WIP issues, what's currently being worked on, and anything that may need to move to the actual README file

## Version
Version: 2.0 - TBD
Build Date: N/A

# WIP Version TODO list
* Test the gen can bus filter function
	- Intent is that the various defined data channels should be associated with an CANbus PID, so only let through those messages. This shouldn't have to be hard-coded and can be programmatically generated at the start of the program.

# Development Finishing
* sys.py file
    + remember to udpate "root_dir" for development vs final use
    + remember to include the rPIGPIO library for final use

# Future Updates
Include any items below in the appropriate README.md file section
